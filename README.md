# Social Network API

## Description

This Social Network API is the back-end for a social network web application in which users can share their thoughts, friend other users, and react to friends' thoughts. The project uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the NoSQL database, and Mongoose as the ODM. This project helped me practice using Mongoose to query the MongoDB database via Node.js. It also helped me understand how existing social networking platforms manage large amounts of unstructured data.
